  * doesn't require Github  
* **GitHub:**

  * visually track changes   
  * easily collaborate on files

undo add: After you've added a change undo it using `git reset HEAD filename`  
undo commit: After you've made a commit undo it using `git reset --soft HEAD~1` or `git reset HEAD~1`  
undo push:After you've pushed to the remote undo it using `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
